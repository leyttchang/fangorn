## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-12

- Fixed: dragging the dock panel below the palette list's true minimum
  height didn't shrink it — the buttons kept rendering at full size past the
  panel's allocated space and visually overlapped the bottom tab strip
  (Output/Debugger/etc.) below it. The panel now clips its content to its
  own bounds, so an undersized panel just shows fewer buttons (already
  scrollable) instead of bleeding into the tabs.
- Added a small ✕ button next to Custom Min Size that resets both fields to
  0 in a single undo step.
- Fixed: the info panel's minimum width (180px) predated the Constants
  section and was too narrow for its longest label ("Text Outline Size:")
  plus a SpinBox, so dragging the panel down toward that minimum clipped the
  SpinBox's up/down arrows. Raised to 230px.
- Added a zoom percentage field next to Reset View — type an exact value
  (10-800%) instead of only scroll-wheel. Stays in sync with scroll-wheel
  zoom and Reset View in both directions.
- Added double-click on a canvas box as a rename shortcut — jumps straight
  into the sidebar Name field, selected and ready to type over.
- Added **Set as Build Target** to the right-click menu, for pointing the UI
  Builder at a node already on the canvas without going back to the Scene
  tree / Use Selected as Target.
- Added arrow-key nudge: moves the selected node(s) by 1px (Shift+arrow for
  a Grid Snap-size step). Works on a multi-selection, skips Container
  children (same reasoning as Resize), and holding a key down stays a single
  undo step instead of one per key-repeat.
- Added a filter box above the palette to narrow its 37 types down by name
  instead of scrolling.
- Palette buttons are now a fixed width (sized to the longest label) instead
  of stretching to fill the column, so they don't turn into oddly wide bars
  when the panel's floated into a large window; also fixes a horizontal
  scrollbar that could appear alongside the vertical one.
- Fixed: the palette's info-panel diagrams (VBoxContainer/GridContainer/etc.
  layout illustrations) stretched to fill the info panel's full width and
  looked distorted/sparse once the panel was wide (e.g. floated into a large
  window). Now capped to a fixed width, left-aligned, regardless of how wide
  the panel gets.
- Added rubber-band multi-select on the canvas: drag over empty space to
  select everything the band touches, Shift+click to add/remove a single
  box, Shift+drag to add a band to the existing selection. Feeds the same
  EditorSelection Align/Distribute/Match Size/Grid Snap already use, so
  multi-select no longer requires the Scene tree.
- Added smart alignment guides: dragging a freely-positioned node (not a
  Container reorder) now snaps to, and shows a guide line for, a sibling's
  or the parent's own edge/center when close, like Figma/Sketch-style guides.
  Also applies while dragging a brand new node in from the palette, not just
  when repositioning an existing one. Can be turned off in **Project
  Settings → UI Builder → Enable Alignment Guides** (persisted per project).
- Right-click menu now handles multi-selections: **Duplicate Selected (N)**
  and **Delete Selected (N)** act on the whole selection instead of just the
  clicked node, and right-clicking a node that's already part of a
  multi-selection keeps the whole selection instead of collapsing it down to
  just the one clicked (Explorer/Finder-style).
- Added Copy (Ctrl+C) / Paste (Ctrl+V), also in the right-click menu. Unlike
  Duplicate, Paste can target a different parent than the original —
  right-click a different box (or empty canvas space, for the build target)
  → **Paste into...**. Each paste is an independent copy, so pasting
  multiple times doesn't reuse the same node.
- Lowered the claimed minimum engine version from Godot 4.7 to **4.6** —
  nothing in the addon actually requires 4.7 specifically (FoldableContainer,
  used for the Constants section, only needs 4.5+), and manual testing on
  4.6 turned up no issues.
- UI Builder now registers via add_control_to_dock(DOCK_SLOT_BOTTOM) instead
  of add_control_to_bottom_panel() — same wide, full-editor-width placement
  at the bottom as before, but now supports Godot's native "Make Floating"
  (right-click its tab), since add_control_to_bottom_panel() panels are a
  separate, more restricted mechanism that doesn't support floating at all.
- Fixed: the canvas's right-click context menu (Delete/Duplicate/Select
  Parent) could pop up far from the cursor — even off in a second monitor —
  once the panel was floated into its own window, since it used a
  window-relative coordinate as if it were desktop-absolute. Now queries the
  real OS cursor position instead.
- Info panel now shows editable theme constant fields for more node types,
  grouped into a collapsible **Constants** section (like the Inspector's own
  Theme Overrides category) instead of sitting flat under Name: **Margin
  Left/Top/Right/Bottom** (MarginContainer), **Separation** (HSplitContainer,
  VSplitContainer, HSeparator, VSeparator — same field VBoxContainer/
  HBoxContainer already had), **H/V Separation** (HFlowContainer,
  VFlowContainer), **Side Margin** (TabContainer), and **Text Outline Size**
  (ProgressBar). Fields are grid-aligned so labels and values line up in
  columns.
- Fixed: inserting a template into an empty build target now automatically
  switches the target to the newly inserted template's root, instead of
  leaving it pointed at the (now-populated) outer wrapper — previously,
  drops/clicks meant for the template's own content could land as siblings
  of it instead. Targets with existing content are left alone, since that
  may be a deliberate composition.
- Fixed: a newly created container node (e.g. VBoxContainer) dropped inside
  another container (e.g. CenterContainer) collapsed to an invisible 0x0 dot,
  since Containers ignore a child's plain size and only respect
  Custom Min Size. New nodes now get their default size applied as
  Custom Min Size too, but only when their parent is a Container — resize-
  drag on non-Container parents is untouched.
- Added a popup explaining when/why Custom Min Size got auto-set on a new
  container child, with a "Don't remind me again for this project" checkbox
  (persisted in project.godot) instead of silently happening with no
  explanation.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-12

Initial release.

- **UI Builder** (bottom panel): drag-and-drop node creation on a pan/zoomable
  schematic canvas with rulers and a viewport outline, live resize/reposition/
  reorder, a 37-type node palette, reusable UI/HUD templates, per-node info
  panel with inline editing, and duplication.
- **Alignment Tools** (left dock): align, distribute, match size, grid snap,
  and theme presets (dark_ui, light_ui), with anchor-aware positioning.
- Full undo/redo support throughout, via Godot's `EditorUndoRedoManager`.
